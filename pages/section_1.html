            <br />“Frieder Nake, pioneer of computer art and professor at the
            University of the Arts Bremen, once jokingly said in a lecture that
            I attended in 2018: ‘The Internet is just a collection of
            hyperlinks’, certainly knowing that in just 30 years the Internet
            became much more than that. It became people’s newspaper, library,
            cinema, archive, community and workplace.” event.preventDefault()

            A clear oversimplification which assumes a poetic license suitable
            for my choice of topics and the voice through which I will present
            them. I am not looking to discuss technical facts through this text
            as there are plenty of resources online which will present this
            information.
            <br />
            My historical and technical references will be kept brief, their
            sole purpose being that of weaving the theoretical fabric in which
            the information exists, rather than offering a textbook style
            education on the matter. I will base my historical references on
            three pillars, reflecting the purposes they serve in relation to
            choice of topics and the voice through which I present them. These
            shall be: style, purpose and format.
