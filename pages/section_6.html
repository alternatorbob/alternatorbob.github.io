              In thinking about the future of web design and development, I
              bring up the mainstream hypothesis of a metaverse future through
              the lens of platform capitalism.
              <br />
              Meta’s head first launch towards the ‘future’ has burned through
              venture capital and employees faster than you can say Moore. Their
              stubborness to make this a now thing is being barricaded by the
              finite amount of people that are willing to bring the screen that
              one step closer. It’s common to consider technologies disruptive
              by the number of early adopters, and clunky VR headset attempts
              from the 90s act as the perfect artefact of VR not having really
              caught on.
              <br />
              <br />
              Meta is ofcourse not single handedly slaying the dragon, but the
              race’s main purpose seems to be transforming investor’s bank
              accounts and stock portfolios, rather than the face of human
              computer interaction.
              <br />
              A tasty slice of this mentality can be savoured with a side of
              cringe in
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S-4mTvK4cI&t=1s"
                >this video</a
              >
              from Matthew Ball, angel investor and heavy promoter of the
              metaverse.
              <br />
              The video begins with a ‘making this a now thing’ style statement,
              through which he ensures the viewer that “we’re going to go
              there.” As he fixates the camera with a demonic corporatist stare
              only Zucky’s trial has brought to the internet, he relays
              information that is true in the objective reality of the product (
              i.e, the history in gaming and beneficial applications), however
              it quickly becomes clear through the narrative and tone that the
              purpose of the video is to convince, rather than inform the
              viewer.

              In the same discourse of people wanting to regain control of what
              they consume in order stop being reared by large corporations,
              many have started to get their hands dirty by first researching
              alternatives and creating solutions for themselves which provide a
              higher degree of transparency or even full control in the case of
              self developed solutions.

              Self-hosting for example, are websites hosted on a server that is
              owned and operated by the website owner. On the other hand, there
              is the cloud-based approach, where websites are hosted on servers
              that are managed by a third-party provider. This debate is closely
              tied to the larger discussion about the centralization vs
              decentralization of the internet. As people become more aware of
              the potential for platform capitalism to exploit their data and
              influence their behavior, many are seeking to regain control over
              their online presence by self-hosting their websites.
              <br />
              The holy grail of self hosting is this solar powered website.
              “Low-tech Magazine questions the belief in technological progress,
              and highlights the potential of past knowledge and technologies
              for designing a sustainable society. Because a web redesign was
              long overdue -- and because we try to practice what we preach --
              we decided to build a low-tech website that meets our needs and
              abides by our principles. To reduce energy use, we opted for a
              back to basics web design, using a static site instead of a
              database driven content management system. We further apply
              default typefaces, dithered images, off-line reading options, and
              other tricks to lower energy use far below that of the average
              website. In addition, the low resource requirements and open
              design help to keep the blog accessible for visitors with older
              computers and/or less reliable Internet connections. Because it
              uses so little energy, this website can be run on a mini-computer
              with the processing power of a mobile phone. It needs 1 to 2.5
              watts of power, which is supplied by a small, off-grid solar PV
              system on the balcony of the author’s home. Typical for
              off-the-grid renewable power systems, energy storage is limited.
              This means that the website will go off-line during longer periods
              of cloudy weather.”

          <div class="text-l">Dissolving attention spans</div>

          <p class="pt-20 text-s grotesk-medium">
            The digital age has brought about numerous changes in the way
            individuals consume media and information. One of the most prominent
            of these changes is the apparent shortening of attention spans,
            particularly among the Z Generation. <br />
            This phenomenon can largely be attributed to two factors: the filter
            bubble doom scroll and the prevalence of image-based media such as
            TikTok. The filter bubble doom scroll refers to the personalized
            algorithms used by social media platforms to curate content for
            users, resulting in a narrow and sometimes biased view of the world.
            Meanwhile, TikTok, as well as other image-based media, is known for
            its quick-paced and highly visual content, which can be more
            engaging but also less informative than text-based media. In
            contrast, text-based media such as books or journals have been long
            considered a source of in-depth and thoughtful information. They
            offer a more comprehensive view of the world and allow for a deeper
            understanding of complex issues. However, the Z Generation is
            increasingly turning away from these sources in favor of the quick
            gratification and entertainment provided by image-based media. This
            shift has raised concerns about the potential for a decline in
            critical thinking skills and the spread of misinformation. As a
            result, it is essential to consider the impact of these media
            choices on the future of society and to encourage the Z Generation
            to engage with a more diverse range of media.

            For me the point of no return, is his mention of the metaverse being
            THE metaverse, as in there can only be a single metaverse. Him
            presenting this argument is hard to digest considering that he only
            invests in meta which is only one of many companies working on
            developing the couch-locked virtual vacation of your dreams. The
            last straw is reading the dude’s Linkedin bio: “I spend my time
            thinking about the way technology is disrupting established business
            models...” The accent is clearly being put on the potential for
            financial gain, in the same tone of the video through which he tries
            to puppeteer unsuspecting people into financing the market he
            already controls.
            <br /><br />
            In the discourse of centralised vs decentralised systems, and the
            previously mentioned push for the future, one might ask, how can the
            metaverse even be a shared platform if it’s owned by private
            companies?

            As attention spans continue to shrink, it is likely that the future
            of websites will be shaped by the need for quick and easily
            digestible content. Websites will need to be designed with a more
            streamlined and minimalistic approach, with a focus on visual
            elements rather than text-heavy content. This trend has already
            begun to emerge, with an increasing number of websites adopting a
            “card” format, where information is presented in short, bite-sized
            snippets.
            <br />
            Additionally, websites will likely incorporate more interactive and
            multimedia elements, such as videos and animations, to keep users
            engaged and to help convey information in a more engaging manner.
            Moreover, with the growing popularity of voice-activated virtual
            assistants like Siri and Alexa, websites will need to adapt to meet
            the needs of voice-based navigation and search. As a result,
            websites will likely become more conversational in nature, with a
            focus on natural language processing and voice-enabled interfaces.
            <br />
            This shift will impact both the design and development of websites,
            with a greater emphasis on usability and accessibility for users.
            The future of websites, therefore, will be shaped by the evolving
            needs and preferences of users, as well as the technological
            advancements that continue to drive change in the digital landscape.
