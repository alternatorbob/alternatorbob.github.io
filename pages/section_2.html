            To get an understanding of the importance of online curatorial
            platforms, we might commence by observing the dynamic and vast
            nature of the internet. Millions of websites and web pages are
            constantly being created, updated, and deleted, and with the sheer
            volume of information available, it would be impossible for a single
            person to be aware of all the relevant information related to this
            field, or any other one for that matter. Online curatorial platforms
            emerge in the form of collections, carefully presenting us with a
            rich palette of webpages that explore contemporary uses of the
            browser. Through the global communities formed around a broadcasted
            voice in design, the synergistic nature of the relationship between
            the designer and the curatorial platform, is propelling interaction
            and graphic design into a new stage.

          <div class="text-l">Template Hell: No Code Cornucopia</div>

          <p class="pt-20 text-s grotesk-medium">
            The rise of ready-made website platforms has made it easier than
            ever to create a website, but this convenience has come at a cost.
            The abundance of templates available has led to a phenomenon known
            as “template hell”, where websites all begin to look the same and
            lack originality. This not only affects businesses, but it also
            stifles creativity in the web design community. Boring and
            repetitive templates limit the imagination and vision of designers,
            forcing them to conform to pre-existing design patterns. This can
            result in a homogenized web, where creativity and uniqueness are
            lost. It is important to remember that a website is more than just a
            platform for information; it is a canvas for creativity and
            self-expression. On the other hand, independent web design studios
            offer a breath of fresh air in this homogenized web. These studios
            prioritize creativity and originality, producing websites that are
            not only functional but also visually stunning. They provide a space
            for designers to experiment, push boundaries, and showcase their
            talent. This not only benefits businesses, but it also inspires
            other designers and helps to cultivate a vibrant web design
            community. Furthermore, independent web design studios often curate
            web design, showcasing the best of the best and promoting the
            importance of creativity in web design. By doing so, they encourage
            designers to continue pushing the boundaries and strive for
            excellence in their craft. In conclusion, while ready-made templates
            may be quick and convenient, they often lack the creativity and
            originality that is vital for a successful and impactful website.
            Independent web design studios provide a much-needed alternative,
            promoting creativity and originality in the web design community.
            They offer a platform for designers to experiment, express their
            vision, and showcase their talent. In a world where the internet is
            an integral part of our daily lives, it is essential that we support
            and celebrate the creativity and originality of independent web
            design studios.
